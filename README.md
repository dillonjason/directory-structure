# Directory Structure

This repo is designed to be an example directory structure that I feel best organizes an isomorphic or front-end only application.

Every node in this app will have a markdown file with clear defnition of what should be in it's location. Each node is named according minus the appropriate extension.

This structure is very opinionated and will be ever evolving as front-end frameworks and patterns change.
