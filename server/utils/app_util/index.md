# Util File

A util file should be either a single function, a collection of functions, or a class. The name of the util folder should be the name of the single function, name of the class, or a simple name that represents the collection of functions.

Nothing inside of this file should rely on another util file.

These functions should be self contained and not rely on any other server file.
