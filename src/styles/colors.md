# Color Variables

This should be a collection of variables the hold hex values.

The variables should be named for their usage and not the color they represent. For example do not make the variable `$light-grey` instead use `$disabled` or don't use `$brand-primary` instead use `$accent`.

Because you will be providing colors as purpose colors will tend to be reused. If this is the case I will sometimes make a variable of say `$_red` but will never use it out side of this file, the leading `_` is to denote this as "private".
